# Friday Night Funkin': BCB


Join our discord! We'd love to have you! https://discord.gg/beC2cddaFq
This is a modified build of the Friday Night Funkin' Engine. Improves on input and asset loading.
Brandon's Custom Build is a build made by me, (Brandon) and (zero) contributers :(.  
  
This mod was made entirely for fun. I'm aware zero people have downloaded it and I don't care. This is all for me to learn.


Play the Original Game: https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371
Some features include:
- New options Menu
- Note rework
- Sick MP4 and WEBM video support :)
- More modding capabilities
- Asset optimization
- and some quality of life improvements.
