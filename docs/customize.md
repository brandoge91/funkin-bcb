# Customization

BCB can be customized in a variety of ways. Here are some ways you can customize it for your mod. (Source Code Only)

##### Mod Name
In **assets/preload/data** there is a file called modName.txt. You can change the contents of this txt to the name of your mod.

##### Remove the Outdated Screen.
In source/TitleState.hx there is a line that says ```FlxG.switchState(new OutdatedSubState());``` 
You can remove this line to remove checking for updates in BCB.

##### MORE COMING SOON!
