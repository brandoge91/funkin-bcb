# Brandon's Custom Build
## Documentation  

This is a ~~sucky~~ somewhat decent attempt at fixing the engine that runs under the hood of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/funkin). This was made to create a engine experience for the people who just want to customize their game more then the default game and even the week 7 update will allow them to.  

Here's a quick list of everything that i can remember on the spot that I changed/added.  
-Better Asset (Pre)Loading  
-Options Menu  
-Freeplay Menu Improvement  
-Funni Transitions lol  

so uh yeah. check the buttons at the top/side of the page to view some epic gamer tutorials/news!
